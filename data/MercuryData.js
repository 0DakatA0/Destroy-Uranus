    explanation:
      "Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. The diminutive planet is about 3,030 miles (4,876 kilometers) in diameter, making it about the size of the continental United States and only slightly bigger than Earth's moon. It's smaller than both Saturn's moon Titan and Jupiter's moon Ganymede. Pluto used to be considered the smallest planet in the solar system, but it was downgraded to a dwarf planet, leaving the distinction to Mercury.",

    hint: "60 miles",
    points: 5,
    explanation:
      "Scientists think that a huge asteroid slammed into Mercury about 4 billion years ago, creating a giant crater about 960 miles (1,545 km) across. Called the Caloris Basin, the crater could fit the whole state of Texas inside it. Researchers have calculated that the asteroid that created the basin had to have been about 60 miles (100 km) wide.",

    correct_option: "180 000 km/h",
    hint: " Mercury zips around the sun faster than any other planet!",
    points: 10,
    explanation:
      "Mercury zips around the sun faster than any other planet. It travels about 112,000 mph (180,000 km/h) along its elliptical orbit. The planet gets as close as 29 million miles (47 million km) to the sun, and as distant as 43 million miles (70 million km) from the sun. The planet takes only 88 Earth days to completely orbit the sun.",

    options: ["nickel", "steel", "iron", "copper"],
    correct_option: "iron",
    hint: "It's a common metal.",
    points: 5,
    explanation:
      "Mercury's iron core takes up about 75 percent of the planet's radius. The huge core has more iron in it than any other planet's in the solar system. Scientists aren't exactly sure how Mercury's giant iron core formed, but researchers think it has something to do with its formation. If the planet formed quickly, it could have left a thin shell of crust over the relatively large core.",

    correct_option: "none",
    hint: "The first two planets don't have moons.",
    points: 5,
    explanation:
      "Mercury has no moons. The planet's close proximity to the Sun makes having moons impossible, as the star's strong gravitational pull would likely pull them out of the planet's orbit.",
