      "correct_option": "165",
      "hint": "Neptune is far away from the Sun.",
      "points": 5,
      "explanation": "One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate or spin once). And Neptune makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth days).Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet Pluto. Pluto's highly eccentric, oval-shaped orbit brings it inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years. This switch, in which Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune, happened most recently from 1979 to 1999. Pluto can never crash into Neptune, though, because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two. This repeating pattern prevents close approaches of the two bodies.",

      "hint": "Its radius of only 24,764 km",
      "points": 5,
      "explanation": "With an equatorial radius of only 24,764 km, Neptune is smaller than all the other gas giants in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. But here’s the funny thing: Neptune is actually more massive than Uranus by about 18%. Since it’s smaller but more massive, Neptune has  a much higher  density than Uranus. In fact, at 1.638 g/cm3, Neptune is the densest gas giant in the Solar System.",

      "hint": "Neptune Probably Captured its Largest Moon!",
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Neptune’s largest Moon, Triton, circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit. That’s means that it orbits the planet backwards relative to Neptune’s other moons. This is seen as an indication that Neptune probably captured Triton – i.e. the moon didn’t form in place like the rest of Neptune’s moons. Triton is locked into a synchronous rotation with Neptune, and is slowly spiraling inward towards the planet.",
